This repository contains a program called todo_list.py that allows the user to add, view, and manage their tasks. 

When the user is prompted to enter a task, they should enter it exactly as they would like it to appear on their to do list. 

When the user is prompted to enter y to continue or n to to finish the program, they should enter y if they would like to continue making changes to their list (by adding, deleting, viewing, etc.) and only enter n when they are completely satisfied. 

Thank you for running this program
